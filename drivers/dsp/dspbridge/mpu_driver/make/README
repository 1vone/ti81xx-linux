            Instructions to build MPU side DSP/BIOS Bridge driver

Environment variables should be set before start building the bridge driver.
Typical environment variable settings are provided below. Once environment
variables are configured, change the current directory to dspbridge/src to
build the sources.

Three different levels of debug binaries can be built by specifying different
arguments to 'make'.

Arguments:BUILD=debug
Debug Level:Debugging symbols used by GDB and all bridge debug messages

Arguments:BUILD=rel
Debug Level: No debugging symbols used by GDB and all bridge debug messages

In all above cases, the binaries will be placed in the host directory
configured through the environment variable. Then they will be copied to
target file system after stripping debug symbols (if any). Thus, debugging
tools on host have access to the symbols, while the same code is loaded on
target with a smaller file size.

example environment varibles to be set for builds:
---------------------------------------------------

export LINUXROOT=$HOME/omap
export PREFIX=$LINUXROOT/dspbridge

echo Setting local environment for 2.6 Kernel, GCC 3.4
export MVLROOT=/opt/mvlcee
export TGTROOT=/data/omapsw_linux/$USER/upload/target-24xx
export KRNLSRC=$LINUXROOT/kernel/2.6_kernel
export PATH=$PATH:/data/omapts/linux/arm-tc/gcc-3.4.0/bin:$MVLROOT/host/bin
