Quick Start Guide
=================

1. Configure kernel as by default config.

3. After setting the default config file, do a menuconfig and change as
   follows:

    System Type  --->
	[*] Enable TI OMAP Power Management
    Power management options  --->
	OMAP power management options  --->
            [ ] Disable h/w supervised control of EMU clock domain

    Device Drivers  --->
    	[ ] USB support  --->

These changes will setup TI clock framework needed by the driver and also avoid
an USB issue that is present when enabling TI OMAP PM will be fixed in the next
release, then build the kernel.

3. When compiling bridge driver you must set the DISABLE_BRIDGE_PM flag,
   since this functionality is not fully ported.
   i.e. make PREFIX=top_path KRNLSRC=kernel_path PROJROOT=mpu_driver_folder
   	     TGTROOT=top_path BUILD=rel CMDDEFS="DISABLE_BRIDGE_PM"

For compilation and installation detailed instructions please refer to
README files in mpu_driver folder.
